// PROBLEM STATEMENT 01
   You are given two strings word1 and word2. 
   Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. 
   If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
   Return the merged string.


class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) 
    {
        int m = word1.size(), n = word2.size();
        string ans;
        for (int i=0;i<m || i<n;i++)
        {
            if ( i< m)
            ans += word1[i];
            if (i < n)
            ans += word2[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
