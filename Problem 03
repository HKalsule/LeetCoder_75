// PROBLEM STATEMENT
   Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
   A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. 
   The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
   Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
   Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. 
   The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

public:
    string reverseWords(string s)
    {        
        int i = 0;   
        int j = 0;     
        int n = s.size();
        while (i < n)
        {
            while (i < n && s[i] == ' ') 
            {
                ++i;
            }
            if (i < n)
            {
                if (j != 0)
                {
                    s[j++] = ' ';
                }
                int k = i;
                while (k < n && s[k] != ' ')
                {
                    s[j++] = s[k++];
                }
                reverse(s.begin() + j - (k - i), s.begin() + j);
                i = k;
            }
        }
        s.erase(s.begin() + j, s.end());
        reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
        return s;
